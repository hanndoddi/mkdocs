## **Innovating at the Intersection of Technology and Community**

As the Director of Fab Lab Ísafjörður in Iceland, I lead efforts to bridge the gap between education, industry, and the community. With a proven track record as a Project Manager in the government relations industry, I specialize in aligning technological innovation with public sector needs.

My multidisciplinary expertise spans Electronics, Communication, CAD, CNC Machining, and Programming, allowing for a well-rounded approach to problem-solving.

 Holding a Diploma in Digital Fabrication from Fab Academy, I’ve honed advanced digital fabrication techniques. Passionate about using technology to drive meaningful change, I am dedicated to fostering collaboration and innovation across sectors.
